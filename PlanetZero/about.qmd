# Welcome to PlanetZero!

We are Bronsted Labs, a passionate team of students from Kiira College Butiki driven by a shared concern for our environment. PlanetZero is our project dedicated to empowering citizen scientists in the fight against pollution.

Through informative articles published here, authored by both our team and dedicated volunteers with expertise in various environmental fields, we aim to raise awareness, inspire action, and provide practical solutions to tackle this critical global issue.

We believe that by working together, we can make a significant difference. Citizen scientists of all backgrounds are welcome to contribute their knowledge and experiences. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply a concerned citizen, we encourage you to join our community and be part of the solution.

## Here's what you'll find on PlanetZero:

+ In-depth articles: Explore a wide range of topics related to pollution, its causes, effects, and potential solutions.

+ Citizen science opportunities: Participate in ongoing citizen science projects or propose your own!

+ Actionable tips: Learn practical ways to reduce your own environmental footprint and make a positive impact.
