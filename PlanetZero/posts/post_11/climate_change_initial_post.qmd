I salute you all for the tremendous support you have rendered toward our mission, "Meeting Climate Justice."

In the past, people lived in an environment that was generally more stable and conducive to both human and animal life. There were fewer challenges related to climate extremes, such as global warming, heavy rainfall, and prolonged droughts.

However, significant changes began in the mid-20th century with the rise of industrialization. This shift aimed to meet the increasing demand for modern conveniences and lifestyles. Unfortunately, industrialization often involves the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect" that leads to global warming and climate change.

As temperatures rise, we face a range of environmental challenges, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems.

In conclusion, I urge everyone to adopt strategies for both mitigation—reducing greenhouse gas emissions—and adaptation—adjusting to the impacts of climate change. Together, we can work toward a more sustainable and equitable future.
